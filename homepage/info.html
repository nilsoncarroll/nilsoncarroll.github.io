      <div align="center"> <p>My name is Nilson (16). I am from Rochester, NY. I will be exploring queer glitches made within the Dragon Quest games this month. I hope to stream some live glitches on twitch, I will let you know. I will be using these glitches to construct a new Dragon Quest narrative <a href="../welcometomyhomepage.html">here</a> as the month goes on. ~ nilson, july 1, 2020 ~<hr>
          <p>some text I sent cody today: <br>
There's a part at the very end of Dragon Warrior 3 where you use this item the -Rainbow Drop-<br> 
at this cliff and the -Rainbow Bridge appears- and I spent a very long time with this one<br> glitched
save state, sort of getting lucky and being able to force it through the game, and <br>somehow I
ended up with the rainbow drop in my possession at the right place and so i used it <br>and when
I crossed the rainbow bridge i got this text that said "You are no longer invisible." <br>and i think that
I might just start weeping now it was perfect, I didnt even get a screenshot it was so <br>fast but it
made me realize something, that a lot of what I fight against with the game is this <br>notion that
you are the son of the legendary hero, your father's god dna is stuck in your veins - <br>but the final
sequence of the game has you going back to where the first game takes place, where <br>the original
hero had to find the rainbow drop himself and make his own bridge, and i guess that <br>legacy reminds
me now of the queer lineage and legacy that i am following in, my father's dna be damned. <br>~ nilson, july 14, 2020 ~<br><br>
