      <div align="center"> <p>My name is Nilson (16). I am from Rochester, NY. I will be exploring queer glitches made within the Dragon Quest games this month. I hope to stream some live glitches on twitch, I will let you know. I will be using these glitches to construct a new Dragon Quest narrative <a href="../welcometomyhomepage.html">here</a> as the month goes on. <br>~ nilson, july 1, 2020 ~<hr>
          <p>some text I sent cody today: <br>
There's a part at the very end of Dragon Warrior 3 where you use this item the -Rainbow Drop-<br> 
at this cliff and the -Rainbow Bridge appears- and I spent a very long time with this one<br> glitched
save state, sort of getting lucky and being able to force it through the game, and <br>somehow I
ended up with the rainbow drop in my possession at the right place and so i used it <br>and when
I crossed the rainbow bridge i got this text that said "You are no longer invisible." <br>and i think that
I might just start weeping now it was perfect, I didnt even get a screenshot it was so <br>fast but it
made me realize something, that a lot of what I fight against with the game is this <br>notion that
you are the son of the legendary hero, your father's god dna is stuck in your veins - <br>but the final
sequence of the game has you going back to where the first game takes place, where <br>the original
hero had to find the rainbow drop himself and make his own bridge, and i guess that <br>legacy reminds
me now of the queer lineage and legacy that i am following in, my father's dna be damned. <br>~ nilson, july 14, 2020 ~<br><br>

          <p>The look of the Dragon Quest glitches on smartphones might be my favorite.<br>
              The pixel density looks best and is very clear. When making the .gifs of<br>
              the glitches, I look for the blink of a cursor or the motion of either the<br>
              hero or an npc, either of which indicates something within the game state is<br>
              still alive. The glitch process is a negotiation of risk, pushing the game<br>
              state. The text for this project gets a little scrambled on smaller resolutions<br>
              though. For this work, the clean NES graphics work best, but I'm still inclined<br>
              to like the blurred monitor quality of true hardware NES graphics. Actually, my<br>
              favorite NES graphic quality is photos off a monitor printed, for like a magazine.<br>
              It'd be interesting to play an actual game with this quality.<br>~ nilson, july 20, 2020 ~

          I'd like to show these glitches in a physical space or real world context, which I know is currently not an option. I think about the time a few months ago I showed some DQ glitches on an open projector night via twitch for babycastles - it was actually my first time using twitch, lol, and my camera fell over because I was doing the whole thing in my bed... I was quite embarrassed, though it was probably okay. I've learned more about the glitch process since then, how to manage the files better and document the glitches easier. I've streamed a few hours of live corruptions here and there, but not much. I love the html package format, and I obviously hold the PDF in high regard, but I think digital work like this still feels best in a weird room in a weird, dark building. I hope everyone stays safe < < <
