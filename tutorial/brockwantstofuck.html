    <h1>ROM HACKING FOR ARTISTS: TUTORIAL 1</h1>

  So, you think you want to become a ROM hacker, huh?  
    <br><br>
    Wouldn't it be cool if video games actually told it like it was?
    <br><br>

    Wouldn't it be cool if video games sounded like how you actually talk?

    I am constantly and always using ROM hacking as a tool to express<br>
    myself and to be an Artist. ROM hacking is a high skill level tool to<br>
    create artworks in the vein of Cory Arcangel and the late Tom Sachs...
    <br><br>

    <em>"The Late Tom Sachs"</em>
    <br><br>
    So what are the games you're playing right now missing?
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    When Brock wants to FIGHT you, perhaps, maybe what should be really going<br>
    on is that Brock wants to FUCK you, and that, of course, you want to fuck him back.
    <br><br>
    This is the Ultimate Artist Subversion of the Norm through ROM hacking.

    Obviously, in today's post post modern, photoshopped world, anyone can take<br>
    a screenshot from Pokemon and add some text to it. This is not Art! This is not<br>
    even a meme, which is also art.<br>
    <br>
    The Late Tom Sachs often said about art:<br>
    <blockquote>
    "Art is Not Expression, but something else completely. Art is not the Act of Painting, for instance, but instead, sticking a machete to a boom box. Art is taking a ROM of Pokemon Red and Blue and changing the text to say 'Brock wants to Fuck!'"
    
    </blockquote>
    
    <br><br>
    
    I just want to make Tom Sachs proud.

    You'll need a few things:<br><br>
    &#8226 A Pokemon Red ROM<br>
    &#8226 <a href="https://www.zophar.net/utilities/hexutil.html">A Hex editor</a> - I'll be using Translhextion.<br>
    &#8226 <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/52/">A Table editor - I'll be using Table File Manager</a><br>
    &#8226 A Gameboy Emulator - my favorite is <a href="http://bgb.bircd.org/">BGB</a><br><br>
        OPTIONAL:<br>
    &#8226 <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/2017/10/art_books/Metaphors-on-Vision">Metaphors on Vision by infamous <br>film maker Stab Brakhage, aged 27</a> - a glorious text on life, love, film, <br>food, and friend that is essential for all artists<br><br>

    Our Goal is Simple and Just:<br><br>
    We want to make a Pokemon hack where Brock wants to fuck us instead of fight us with his rock hard onix.<br>
    
    <br>
    <img src="images/poke1.png" padding="10%" width="90%" height="auto">
    <br><br>
    Open your Pokemon Red ROM using your hex editor. You'll see a lot of hex code on the left,<br> some junk on the right. If you highlight some hex, you'll see where and how it's appearing in<br> the right column. It is a currently illegible translation of the hex code.
    <br><br>
    It should say POKEMON RED in there.

    <br><br>
    We need to be able to see the in-game text within this unreadable right column if we want to make it better.<br><br>
    <img src="images/poke2.png" width="100%" height="auto"><br><br>
    Using Search/Relative Search, you can find within the code certain patterns that you know<br> exist. We're looking to edit the word "fight," so use the Relative Search to locate where it<br> could be in the code. In this initial step, it might be best to use a very particular<br> word (such as Charmander) to figure out what some of the alphabetical letters<br> are within the code.<br><br>
    After searching, I'm left with the hex code A5, A8, A6, A7, B3.<br><br>
    If you open your Table Manager, there's a grid that has values for any hex value.<br><br>
    Put "f" in the A5 slot, and you'll figure out that A8 ends up where "i" would be (moving left<br> to right, bottom to top). Fill in the entire alphabet this way. Since Pokemon Red has<br> capital and lower case letters, we can figure out where capital letter values are<br> stored as well (try searching some names or whatever).
    <br><br>

</iframe><br>
    You'll end with a table that looks kind of like this one. Save your .tbl file.<br><br>
    This <a href="https://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue:TBL">site</a> has a bunch of useful info and even a table guide for Pokemon Red and Blue.<br><br>
    Back in your hex editor, apply the table file. <br>For Translhextion, check the Thingy View box to view the right column with your table applied.<br><br>
    There are several times the letter pattern "fight" appears in the game, so we're going to<br> search and change them all. The text is not going to be at all legible in the way it is when<br> displayed in the game, and so sentences and phrases in the code may not be connected<br> as they are in-game. An OP hacker uses wits and skills to get around this,<br> though it's far more erotic to replace all fighting with fucking.<br><br>
    Since "fight" is five letters long and "fuck" is only four, let's add an extra "!" to it for<br> emphasis. You could make it a blank space or whatever, but this is the coolest way to do it.<br><br>
    Translhextion has a feature to find and replace all of a certain pattern, so let's replace all instances of "fight" with "fuck!"<br><br>
    Save your ROM.<br><br>
    Open it in BGB - you'll get an error message you can ignore. (A Real Gameboy wouldn't care, okay)<br><br>

    You'll quickly realize the entire world of Pokemon Red has become just as perverted as you,<br> made further ecstatic by that extra exclaimation point often in the middle of sentences. Here is the highest achievement of ROM hacking.<br><br>
      <img src="images/poke7.png" width="70%" height="auto"><br><br>
    Even your childhood friend who is your neighbor wants to fuck your brains out, but I'm saving<br> my asshole virginity for a certain someone... John can make his own bulba sore, man.<br><br>
          <img src="images/poke9.png" width="70%" height="auto"><br><br>
    Everyone is a fucking pervert now. Good job.<br><br>
              <img src="images/poke10.png" width="70%" height="auto"><br><br>
    Always keep notes on what would enhance your ROM. If we were going to go back into the ROM later, we could change "BUG" into "CUM" to make the ROM even more erotic.<br><br>
    <img src="images/poke12.png" width="70%" height="auto"><br><br>
    After maybe twenty minutes of adventuring, we find our boy's body, dripping with sweat, on the<br> doorstep of one of gaming's sexiest and rock hard men, Brock of Pewter Gym. Brock believes in Rock Hard defense and and even Rock Harder cock.<br><br>
    <img src="images/poke13.png" width="70%" height="auto"><br><br>
    When Brock approaches me and declares that he wants to "fuck!!" I can feel Tom Sachs looking<br> down longingly at me, proud of the art I have made. Since I was a young boy, Brock<br> wanted to fight me, but now he feels the way I do. Brock wants to fuck me. Me!<br> Brock's gonna fuck me in the ass with his rock solid onix rock snake!<br><br>
        Across the internet and across the nation, boys are spraying for days--<br>
